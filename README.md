# Gren tree sitter

An exploration at adding tree-sitter support for the [Gren programming language](https://gren-lang.org/)

## Editor Support

## Thanks

Shamelessly stolen from the [tree-sitter-elm](https://github.com/elm-tooling/tree-sitter-elm) project.

## Want to help?

I would greatly appreciate it, I'm disabled and have a hard time finding the energy and time to devote my time to this project

Help writing some tests or simply find valid gren files, that fail parsing.
Test are located in the `test` folder and separated in parser tests and highlighting tests.
